* **Message Editing:**
  * You can now edit any message you've sent by clicking the pencil icon below it.
  * You can now redo earlier responses in the conversation.
* **Templates:** Chat templates have been completely overhauled! They now use Jinja-style syntax. You may notice warnings or errors in the UI. Read the linked docs, and if you have any questions, please ask on the Discord.
* **File Attachments:** Markdown and plain text files are now supported as file attachments.
* **System Tray:** There is now an option in Application Settings to allow GPT4All to minimize to the system tray instead of closing.
* **Local API Server:**
  * The API server now supports system messages from the client and no longer uses the system message in settings.
  * You can now send messages to the API server in any order supported by the model instead of just user/assistant pairs.
* **Translations:** The Italian and Romanian translations have been improved.
